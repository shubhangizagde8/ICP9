  <b>  Haematopus meadewaldoi </b> <br>

    Also known as the Canary Islands oystercatcher the Canarian oystercatcher <br>
     was a shoveler endemic to Fuerteventura andLanzarote. It was considered a <br>
      subspecies of the African oystercatcher until DNA analysis in 2018 concluded <br>
      that it was more likely to be a subspecies of the Eurasian oystercatcher. <br>
      It was last collected in 2913 and has been considered extinct since the 1980s. <br>

   <b> Labrador Duck </b> <br>

The Labrador duck was a North American duck that became extinct after the <br>
Columbian Exchange, the transfer of human populations, plants, animals, <br>
culture, technology, and diseases between the Americas, West Africa, and  <br>
the Old World. Its last known sighting was in New York in 1878. <br>

   <b> Kangaroo Island Emu </b> <br>

   <b> Dromaius novaehollandiae baudinianus</b> <br>
    
    The Kangaroo Island emu or dwarf emu was restricted to Kangaroo Island, <br>
     Australia and was much smaller in size than the mainland emu. It became  <br>
     extinct in about 1827 due to hunting and habitat loss from burning.<br>

<b>Coturnix novaezelandiae </b> <br>

The New Zealand quail has been extinct since 1875. It was first described <br>
 by Sir Joseph Banks when he visited New Zealand on James Cook’s first voyage. <br>
  In 2007 investigations were conducted to find out whether the quails on <br>
   Tiritiri Matangi Island may be a surviving population of the species but  <br>
a genetic study found that they were Australian brown quail. <br>

<b>Phalacrocorax perspicillatus</b> <br>

The spectacled cormorant or Pallas’s cormorant was a marine bird that <br>
 inhabited Bering Island until it went extinct in the 1850s. Little is <br>
 known about the species although it was described by Georg Steller in <br>
 1741 as large, clumsy, and almost flightless. Cormorants usually taste bad<br>
  when eaten but Steller said the spectacled cormorant was delicious particularly <br>
  when encased in clay and baked in a heated pot.<br>
